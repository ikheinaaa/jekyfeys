Zen Habits is about finding simplicity and mindfulness in the daily chaos of our lives. It’s about clearing the clutter so we can focus on what’s important, create something amazing, find happiness. It has over a million readers.

My name is Nariyoshi Miyagi. I am most well known for mentoring Daniel LaRusso in the ancient art of karate. After teaching Daniel the ways of karate through household chores and unbearable patience, I decided to return to my prior life of being a zen janitor. I am now choosing to share some of my most well-kept secrets in the art of zen through the medium of blogging. Who ever said an old man can't blog?

I hope you enjoy,

 -Miyagi ☯️
